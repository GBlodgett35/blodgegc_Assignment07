-Create an array of letters. 
-Then create an array of counters for each letter
-Create variables for the greatest length and average word length.
-Make a variable for the amount of Q’s in each word.
-To find the average word length, for each word, find the word length and enter it into an array
	-Find the average of the values in the array.
-Write a for loop that goes each letter in the word.
	-Write yet another for loop within that for loop that checks against the array of letters and then ups the counter for that letter. 
	-If it is a Q, add one to the QCounter. 
		-Then after each letter, check the Qcounter against the biggest amount of Q’s found in a single word so far.
		-If it’s bigger, the biggest amount of Q’s in a word becomes that number.
-After all the loops have ran, sort the array of letter counters.
	-The last element in the array will be the most used letter.
